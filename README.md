## Usage

1. **Upload Data**
   - Click the upload area or drag and drop your CSV file
   - The file should contain 15-minute interval energy data
   - Supported format: CSV with datetime, duration, unit, consumption, and generation columns

2. **View Dashboard**
   - The chart shows daily energy consumption
   - Use the date range selector to focus on specific periods
   - Toggle between kWh and cost views using the unit toggle
   - Hover over data points for detailed information

3. **Analyze Insights**
   - View total consumption and costs
   - Check average daily usage
   - Identify highest usage days
   - Monitor usage trends
   - Get potential savings estimates

## Data Format

The application expects a CSV file with the following columns:
- `datetime`: Timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss)
- `duration`: Duration in minutes
- `unit`: Energy unit (e.g., "Wh")
- `consumption`: Energy consumption value
- `generation`: Energy generation value (if applicable)
